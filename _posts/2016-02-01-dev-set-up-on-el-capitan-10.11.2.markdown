Setting up a dev environment on a freshly installed El Capitan 10.11.2 on an iMac (2011 Edition) starting with MacOSX command line tools, customizing a theme for Terminal, and adding a .bash_profile

I found a few upsides on waiting to update to El Capitan. By this time, I didn't have to deal with the System Integrity Protection (SIP) when installing Homebrew, and I accidentally found out I can install MacOSX command line tools without installing XCODE. Thanks to Git for that accident.

With a fresh El Capitan install, I opened Terminal to git clone some Sketch (BTW, darn you Sketch app for forcing me to upgrade to El Capitan) plugins. This is when I was prompted to Get XCode or install Command Line tools. Let's make this TechArticle Part 1 of the series, and these are the starting steps:

1. Open Terminal
2. Type “git clone”

    *Terminal with Step 2*
3. You should see: “xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.”
