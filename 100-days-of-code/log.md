# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Aug 27, 2019
##### (Project Demo: Google Home Page )

**Today's Progress**: Completed Pre-course Project: Google Home page

**Thoughts:** Took almost an hour and a half to finish the CSS using CSS Grid and flexbox which I wasn't very familiar with. Now on to the part I hate. Javascript. I feel like JS and I need a fresh start. Pomodoro breaks for the first 2 hours were missed. Again.

### Day 0: Aug 26, 2019
##### (Set up, Refreshers and Project: HTML & CSS )

**Today's Progress**: Completed Pre-course Lessons:
- How Does the Web Work?
- Command Line Basics
- Git Basics
- The Front End
- Google Page Project (Completed: Semantic HTML Mark up)
- Google Page Project (TBC: CSS Grid and Flex)

**Thoughts:** I went through most of what I already know as fast as I could, but, overall, I feel like the refresher was worth it after being able to answer the knowledge checks. I was able to complete up to the HTML markup of the Google Homepage project. My personal challenge was to be more semantic so I can use CSS Grid and Flexbox instead of doing the basic. That was the point of a 100 days challenge anyway --to challenge myself. I did pomodoro for the first 2 hours then slipped back to not taking breaks. I think that's why I feel spent after a total of 5 hours going through the Lessons and Projects. Next mini goal: do better with Pomodoro and breaks.
