# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: Aug 28, 2019
##### (Project Demo: Google Home Page )

**Today's Progress**: An hour of JS at FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** A bit distracted today. I couldn't focus, but stuck to finishing an hour of JS. I feel that the hardest part about coding is trying to get into that focused zone. As I was doing the JS excercises, I found the phrasing quite confusing and the exercises were jumping 5 steps back then 5 steps forward without proper references unless you click on "Get a hint".

### Day 1: Aug 27, 2019
##### (Project Demo: Google Home Page )

**Today's Progress**: Completed Pre-course Project: Google Home page

**Thoughts:** Took almost an hour and a half to finish the CSS using CSS Grid and flexbox which I wasn't very familiar with. Final files: 3kb HTML file and 4kb CSS but without the dropdown menu for app nav and without the media query to fix for screens lower than 520px. css Now on to the part I hate. Javascript. I feel like JS and I need a fresh start. Pomodoro breaks for the first 2 hours were missed. Again.

### Day 0: Aug 26, 2019
##### (Set up, Refreshers and Project: HTML & CSS )

**Today's Progress**: Completed Pre-course Lessons:
- How Does the Web Work?
- Command Line Basics
- Git Basics
- The Front End
- Google Page Project (Completed: Semantic HTML Mark up)
- Google Page Project (TBC: CSS Grid and Flex)

**Thoughts:** I went through most of what I already know as fast as I could, but, overall, I feel like the refresher was worth it after being able to answer the knowledge checks. I was able to complete up to the HTML markup of the Google Homepage project. My personal challenge was to be more semantic so I can use CSS Grid and Flexbox instead of doing the basic. That was the point of a 100 days challenge anyway --to challenge myself. I did pomodoro for the first 2 hours then slipped back to not taking breaks. I think that's why I feel spent after a total of 5 hours going through the Lessons and Projects. Next mini goal: do better with Pomodoro and breaks.
